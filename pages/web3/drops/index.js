                In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is the massive tree whose roots
                and branches stretch through the nine realms of time and space.
                The concept of a great tree on whose body rests the world,
                though, transcends any culture, and the four-dimensional
                structure of spacetime evokes a similar metaphor.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4">
                We are the fruit of the tree of time, and as we are born we
                become its stewards. In this token we see the image of a tree
                appearing in front of metatron’s cube, a sacred geometric design
                which contains schematic information for all of the platonic
                solids, those mathematically perfect shapes that were once
                theorized to be the building blocks of reality. Yggdrasil is the
                icon of cosmic unity; the blend between the divine feminine
                chaos of nature, and the divine masculine order of math.
